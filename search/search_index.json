Initially, natural numbers (\\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)) were used for counting. The concept of zero was later introduced, expanding the set to whole numbers (\\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)). Fractions led to the development of rational numbers, which can be expressed as the quotient \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, and \\(b \\neq 0\\).</p> <p>The Greeks, using ropes to measure lengths, could represent any rational number. For instance, if a rope is one unit long and divided into three parts, then two parts represent \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). However, the discovery that not all numbers are rational marked a significant advancement in mathematics. It was Hippasus of the Pythagorean school who first suggested that the square root of 2 (\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)) could not be expressed as a fraction, implying its irrationality. He did that by  showing that the diagonal of a square with side length 1 unit cannot be expressed as a rational number, though it clearly exists as a geometric length. This was a shocking revelation, as it contradicted the Pythagorean belief in the universality of rational numbers. </p> <p>The formal proof of the irrationality of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is due to Euclid, who showed that if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) were rational, it would lead to a contradiction, thereby establishing its irrational nature. This proof is a milestone in the history of mathematics, highlighting the existence of numbers beyond the rational spectrum, and leading to the broader concept of real numbers (\\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), which includes both rational and irrational numbers. </p> <p>Thus, the set of rational numbers (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)) has \"gaps,\" which are points on the number line that cannot be represented by any rational number. These gaps correspond to irrational numbers\u2014numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. The existence of these gaps highlights the incompleteness of the rational numbers as a number system when compared to the real numbers (\\(\\mathbb{R}\\)).</p> <p>The real numbers include both rational numbers and irrational numbers, thereby \"completing\" the number line without gaps. This completeness is a fundamental property of the real numbers, essential for the development of calculus, analysis, and much of modern mathematics.</p> <p>In foundational mathematics, real numbers are often introduced through intuitive concepts or as an axiom set, especially at elementary levels, allowing for an immediate application in calculus and analysis. However, in higher mathematics, the construction and properties of real numbers are treated with rigorous formalism, based on set theory and axiomatic frameworks.</p> <p>In the higher mathematics framework, particularly in real analysis, the real numbers (\\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) are constructed and understood through rigorous axiomatic approaches.

This splitting is designed such that, when the series is summed, most intermediate terms cancel each other out, leaving only a few terms at the beginning and end of the series. This phenomenon greatly simplifies the calculation of the series sum, reducing a potentially complex series to a simple expression involving only the first and last terms of the sequence. The ability to transform a series in this way hinges on identifying an appropriate form for each term, often through partial fraction decomposition or similar techniques, which reveals the series' telescoping nature.

Historically, solutions to quadratic equations were identified early on, leading to the development of a general formula that is well-known today. However, finding the roots of cubic equations proved more challenging; it took mathematicians centuries to devise a corresponding formula.</p> <p>The quest continued for a formula to solve higher degree polynomials. Eventually, it culminated with the astonishing discovery by Niels Henrik Abel that no general formula using radicals exists for polynomial equations of degree greater than four. This revelation laid the groundwork for the field of Abstract Algebra, an essential area of higher mathematics.</p> <p>This discussion aims to provide a clear understanding of polynomials, including their properties and the methods for determining the number of roots. We will begin with foundational concepts and incrementally progress to more complex theories and problem-solving techniques.</p> <p>Now, let's define a polynomial.</p> <p>The word \"Polynomial\" originates from the Greek \"poly,\" meaning 'many,' and \"nomial,\" referring to 'terms.' In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression comprising a finite number of terms. Each term is formed from the product of a coefficient and a variable raised to a non-negative integer exponent. The degree of each term is the exponent of the variable, and the degree of the polynomial is the highest degree of any term within the expression.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the polynomial \\( 2xy - 3x^2 \\). This expression consists of two terms and involves two independent variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). The first term includes the coefficient 2 and is associated with both variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), each to the first power, giving the term a total degree of 1 + 1 = 2. The second term has the coefficient -3 and is solely dependent on the variable \\( x \\), which is squared, hence this term has a degree of 2.</p> <p>Consider another polynomial: \\( -3x^3 + 2xy + 4x - 2 \\). This one contains four terms with the variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Analyzing each term: the first has a coefficient of -3 with \\( x \\) raised to the third power, resulting in a degree of 3. The second term, \\( 2xy \\), has a coefficient of 2 and a total degree of 2, resulting from \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) each being to the first power. The third term is \\( 4x \\), with a coefficient of 4 and a degree of 1. The final term is a constant -2, with a coefficient of -2 and a degree of 0. The polynomial's degree is determined by the term with the highest degree, which in this case is 3.</p> <p>Thus, it's clear that even a single constant term qualifies as a polynomial, specifically of degree 0, due to its lack of variables.</p> <p>It is crucial to note that variable exponents in a polynomial must be non-negative integers. This is why the expression \\( 2x^2 - \\frac{1}{x} \\) is not considered a polynomial, as the second term involves \\( x \\) to the negative first power.</p> <p>Furthermore, polynomials are characterized by a finite number of terms. An expression with an infinite number of terms, such as a power series, is distinct from a polynomial and possesses its own set of properties and applications.</p> <p>Consider the series \\( \\frac{x}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{x^n}{n!} + \\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} + \\ldots \\), which is a power series, not a polynomial, because it contains an infinite number of terms.</p> <p>Polynomials can have coefficients that are either real numbers or complex numbers. For those not familiar with complex numbers, there's no need for concern; they will be covered in later chapters. This text will focus on polynomials with real coefficients, also known as real polynomials.</p> <p>A real polynomial in one variable is a polynomial with real coefficients that depends on a single variable. These are also termed univariate polynomials. An example of such a polynomial is \\( P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + a_2x^{n-2} + \\ldots + a_{n-1}x + a_n \\), where each coefficient \\( a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\) is real, and the degree of the polynomial is a non-negative integer \\( n \\). Polynomials are often represented using function notation, such as \\( P \\) for a polynomial dependent on variable \\( x \\). It's common to use capital letters to denote polynomials, although this is not a hard and fast rule. Importantly, the leading coefficient \\( a_0 \\) is non-zero; otherwise, the polynomial's degree would be less than \\( n \\).</p> <p>The term \\( a_0x^n \\) is the leading term, and \\( a_0 \\) is the leading coefficient. Their significance will be elaborated on in subsequent sections.</p> <p>Examples of real polynomials in one variable include:</p> <p>\\( P(x) = 2 \\), \\( P(x) = -3x + 1 \\), \\( P(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 \\), \\( Q(x) = 5x^4 + 2x - 1 \\).</p> <p>Polynomials of degree zero are simply constant polynomials. Polynomials of degree one are called linear, degree two are quadratic, degree three are cubic, degree four are quartic or biquadratic, and degree five are quintic. Polynomials of higher degrees have specific names based on their degree, such as sextic for degree six and septic or heptic for degree seven.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2005%20-%20Polynomials/01%20-%20Introduction/#real-polynomials-of-one-variable","title":"Real Polynomials of one variable:","text":"<p>A polynomial that features real coefficients and is a function of a single variable is known as a real polynomial of one variable, also referred to as a univariate polynomial.</p> <p>Such a polynomial is generally expressed as \\( P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + a_2x^{n-2} + ... + a_{n-1}x + a_n \\), where each of the coefficients \\( a_0, a_1, ..., a_n \\) is real, and the degree of the polynomial is a non-negative integer \\( n \\).

These rays extend indefinitely in their respective directions. The angle between OA and OB angle is the measure of amount of rotation that you must apply to one of the ray, without leaving the original plane,  so that it overlaps with the other ray. </p> <p>So how do we measure angles? How can numbers be connected to the \"amount of rotation\"? One simple yet powerful way of measuring angles was probably introduced by Babylonians about 4000 years ago. This method of measuring angles we are made familiar with in primary classes. To measure the angle between two rays, we can draw a circle, of any radius, with center at O. This circle intersects the rays at points A and B. Now let us cut the circle into 360 equal parts, beginning with a cut at point A, by drawing radial lines emanating from the center O. These radial lines are dividing the circle into 360 equal parts and thus any two consecutive radial lines have the same inclination or angle between them, which we call as \"1 degree\" and denote as 1\u00b0. Thus, a complete circle has a total of 360 degrees.</p> <p> Why did Babylonians divide the circle into 360 equal parts?  Why not 100 or 500 or 100 parts? There are many theories. One theory suggests that 360 is very close to the number of days in a year. Another theory says that they used an angle between the sides of an equilateral triangle as the fundamental angle and divided that angle into 60 equal parts (because Babylonians used a sexagesimal system i.e., their numeral system had a base of 60). Yet another theory suggests that 360 has many factors, 24 to be exact.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>The Babylonians divided the circle into 360 equal parts for several reasons, which are rooted in both their astronomical observations and their numerical system:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Astronomy: The Babylonians were skilled astronomers and noted that the Earth took approximately 360 days to complete its orbit around the Sun. Dividing the circle into 360 parts created a convenient correlation between the daily progression of the Earth and the angular measurement system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerical System: The Babylonians used a sexagesimal (base-60) numerical system. The number 60, and by extension 360, has a large number of divisors, making calculations more practical and flexible. In a sexagesimal system, 360 is 6 x 60, which fits neatly into their numerical framework.</p> </li> <li> <p>Geometry: When working with geometry, particularly in the construction and measurement of angles and segments, having a circle divided into a number divisible by a large number of factors simplifies the process. The number 360 has 24 divisors, making it versatile for constructing various geometric shapes and for practical applications like land division.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These reasons combined made 360 an attractive number for the division of the circle, and this convention has persisted throughout history due to its practicality and the legacy of Babylonian mathematics.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2006%20-%20Trigonometry/02-Basics%20of%20Measurement%20of%20Angles/#sexagesimal-system","title":"Sexagesimal System","text":"<p>To measure the angle between OA and OB, we now calculate how many parts lie between OA and OB. This count may not be a whole number if OB lies between two radial lines. We choose the whole part as the angle and neglect the partial part. Counting of parts can be easily done if we mark the point A as zero and calibrate in the anticlockwise direction the rest of the intersection points of radial lines with the circle. Suppose B lies between 35 and 36, then the angle between OA and OB is 35 degrees. We have some error in this measurement because of that neglected partial degree.</p> <p></p> <p>To minimize this error, we divide each degree into 60 equal parts and calibrate accordingly. Each part is called a minute. Thus, one degree is equal to 60 minutes. The minute is denoted by the prime symbol (\u2032). Now we can measure the angle with more accuracy. If the ray OB lies between 23 and 24 minutes, we measure this as 23\u2032 only. Thus the angle is 35\u00b023\u2032.</p> <p></p> <p>Summary</p> <p>For further accuracy, 1\u2032 is divided into 60 parts. Each part is called a second. Thus, 1\u2032 is equal to 60\u2033 (seconds is denoted by double prime). In the above figure, the ray OB lies between 8\u2033 and 9\u2033. Thus the angle is 35\u00b023\u20328\u2033.</p> <p>So, this system divides a circle into 360 degrees, each degree into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds.

Then the angle between OA and OB is the longitude of point P.</p> <p>Latitudes and Longitudes are measured either in Degree/Minutes/Seconds (DMS) or Decimal Degrees (DD) System.</p> <p>In the DMS system, which we just learned above, the accuracy is only up to 1\". In DMS we cannot measure below 1\". This is an error of around 31 meters on the surface of the Earth. In this system, if there are two points at a distance less than 31 m, their latitudes and longitudes will be the same in this system.</p> <p>To achieve more accuracy, we use decimals and thus the name decimal degrees. Instead of using minutes and seconds, we use decimal fractions to any degree of accuracy. With just 5 decimal places we can acquire an accuracy of 1 m on the Earth\u2019s surface. In decimal degrees, each degree is divided into 10 parts. Each part is again divided into 10 more parts and this process is continued to any level of accuracy. Clearly, \u03b8 = 32.234\u00b0 represents an angle that lies between 32\u00b0 and 33\u00b0. If we divide the degree between 32\u00b0 and 33\u00b0 into 10 parts, then \u03b8 lies between 2 and 3 (3rd part) i.e. 32.2\u00b0 and 32.3\u00b0. If each of these parts is divided into 10 parts, then \u03b8 lies between 3 and 4 (4th part) i.e. 32.23\u00b0 and 32.24\u00b0. \u03b8 = 32.234\u00b0 indicates that \u03b8 lies between 4 and 5 (5th part) i.e. 32.234\u00b0 and 32.235\u00b0.

But in trigonometry defining such an angle is of great utility.</p> <p>So how do we define angles greater than 360\u00b0?</p> <p>We define such angles using the concept of rotation. Let us draw a circle of some radius in the cartesian coordinate system, its centre being at origin O. The circle cuts the positive x-axis, positive y-axis, negative x-axis and negative y-axis at A, B, A' and B' respectively. We call OA as the reference line. The direction of positive x-axis is the reference direction. Suppose there is some variable point P on the circle. There is a ray joining O to P. Initially suppose P is at A. Let us assume that the angle between OA and OP is 0\u00b0. Now P starts moving and reaches another location. The angle between OA and OP has changed. If the new angle is \u03b8, we say, P has covered an angle \u03b8 on the circle. P is said to be the terminal point of angle \u03b8. We follow the following rules to write down the value of \u03b8:</p> <p>Rule 1: \\( \\theta \\) is measured from the positive x-axis.</p> <p>Rule 2: If point P moves anticlockwise, the angle \\( \\theta \\) increases by the amount of angle it moved and if it moves clockwise, the angle \\( \\theta \\) decreases by the amount of angle it moved.</p> <p></p> <p>Consider the following example to clearly understand the dynamics of measuring angles in this way:</p> <p>Suppose P is at A, the angle now is 0\u00b0. Now it starts moving anticlockwise and reaches B. The amount of angle it moved is 90\u00b0. Thus angle \\( \\theta = 0\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 90\u00b0 \\). After reaching B, the point starts moving clockwise and eventually reaches B'. The amount of angle moved is 180\u00b0. What is the value of angle \\( \\theta \\)? \\( \\theta \\) will decrease by the amount the point P moved, i.e., Now \\( \\theta = 90\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = -90\u00b0 \\). </p> <p></p> <p>Consider the following sequence of operations to make it more clear.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Suppose \\( \\theta = 60^\\circ \\) initially. If the terminal point P rotates by an angle \\( 30^\\circ \\) anticlockwise, the new value of \\( \\theta \\) is \\( \\text{old value} + 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ + 30^\\circ = 90^\\circ \\)</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Suppose \\( \\theta = 60^\\circ \\) initially. If the terminal point \\( P \\) rotates by an angle \\( 30^\\circ \\) clockwise, the new value of \\( \\theta \\) is \\( \\text{old value} - 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 30^\\circ \\).</p> </li> <li> <p>When \\( \\theta = 0^\\circ \\), the point \\( P \\) is at \\( A \\), it starts moving in the anticlockwise direction, it reaches \\( B \\), \\( \\theta \\) becomes \\( 90^\\circ \\). It keeps on moving anticlockwise, \\( \\theta \\) keeps on increasing. It reaches \\( A' \\), the angle \\( \\theta \\) becomes \\( 180^\\circ \\). Then it reaches \\( B' \\) and the angle becomes \\( 270^\\circ \\) (3 right angles are covered). Then it reaches \\( A \\), the angle covered is \\( 360^\\circ \\). One complete revolution is done. If it continues moving after this point onwards, \\( \\theta \\) keeps on increasing and it again reaches \\( B \\) and the angle \\( \\theta \\) is \\( 360^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 450^\\circ \\) now. This way if it keeps on moving anticlockwise, the angle \\( \\theta \\) keeps on increasing.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Again let the point \\( P \\) be at \\( A \\) and \\( \\theta \\) be \\( 0^\\circ \\). Suppose \\( P \\) begins moving clockwise and reaches \\( B' \\), the angle \\( \\theta \\) decreases by \\( 90^\\circ \\) i.e. \\( \\theta = 0^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -90^\\circ \\). Suppose \\( P \\) keeps on moving clockwise and reaches \\( A' \\), \\( \\theta \\) becomes \\( -180^\\circ \\). When \\( \\theta \\) reaches \\( B \\), the angle is \\( -270^\\circ \\) and so on.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let us plot some angles:</p> <p>a. 1009\u00b0  Since, 1009\u00b0 = 1080\u00b0 - 71\u00b0, which we can interpret as an anticlockwise rotation of 1080\u00b0 and then a clockwise rotation of 71\u00b0. Also, 1080\u00b0 = 3\u00d7360\u00b0 which is not coincidental. We had chosen 1080\u00b0 in such a way that it is the closest multiple of 360\u00b0 to the given angle 1009\u00b0. In this way it is easier to plot the angle. For we can now just say that 1009\u00b0 can be obtained by 3 anticlockwise full revolutions and then move clockwise by 71\u00b0. </p> <p>b. -596\u00b0</p> <p>Since, -596\u00b0 = -720\u00b0 + 124\u00b0 = -2\u00d7360\u00b0 + 124\u00b0, we can interpret this angle as: Take 2 revolutions clockwise and then move anticlockwise by 124\u00b0. You may have some other interpretation. For example, -596\u00b0 = -7\u00d790\u00b0 + 34\u00b0. This can be interpreted as: Move 7 right angles clockwise and then move 34\u00b0 anticlockwise.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Incorporating time measurement in Angles</p> <p>The motivation of measuring angles this way comes from Physics. Measuring angles by the concept of rotation introduces a temporal aspect, akin to the passage of time, though it is not a direct measure of time itself. When we say an angle is 720 degrees, we imply that a point or a ray has completed two full rotations, or cycles, around a circle. This is similar to a clock hand making two complete cycles around the clock face, which represents the passage of 12 hours. </p> <p>In this way, the measurement of angles in degrees, especially those greater than 360 degrees, can be thought of as analogous to counting laps or revolutions. Each 360-degree increment represents one full cycle, and additional degrees represent progress into subsequent cycles. The concept of multiple cycles is essential in various applications, such as in phase angles in electrical engineering or in describing periodic motion in physics, where the progression through cycles over time is a fundamental aspect of the phenomena being described.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2006%20-%20Trigonometry/02-Basics%20of%20Measurement%20of%20Angles/#coterminal-angles","title":"Coterminal Angles","text":"<p>We also observe one very important thing that if the terminal point is at some location such that the angle is \\( \\theta \\), then for the same location the angle can also be \\( 360^\\circ + \\theta \\), \\( 720^\\circ + \\theta \\), ...or \\( -360^\\circ + \\theta \\) or \\( -720^\\circ + \\theta \\).

When triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in proportion. For any right-angled triangle, if we take the angle \\( \\theta \\) as one of the non-right angles, the side opposite to \\( \\theta \\) is called the perpendicular, the side adjacent to \\( \\theta \\) is called the base, and the longest side, opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse.</p> <p>Because the triangles \\( \\triangle OA_1B_1 \\), \\( \\triangle OA_2B_2 \\), and \\( \\triangle OAB \\) are similar (as they share the same angle \\( \\theta \\)), the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal and constant for a given angle \\( \\theta \\), regardless of the size of the triangle.

Now we know that this is due to the principle of similar triangles. When two right-angled triangles have the same acute angle \\( \\theta \\), they are similar, which means their corresponding sides are proportional.</p> <p>This proportionality is the basis for trigonometric ratios. For instance, if you double the lengths of all sides of a right-angled triangle, the ratios of the lengths of the sides (perpendicular to base, base to hypotenuse, perpendicular to hypotenuse) do not change. Hence, the values of \\( \\sin\\theta \\), \\( \\cos\\theta \\), \\( \\tan\\theta \\), \\( \\csc\\theta \\), \\( \\sec\\theta \\), and \\( \\cot\\theta \\) are invariant.</p> <p>Moreover, because these ratios are constant for a given angle, they are often tabulated or encoded into scientific calculators and computer functions, allowing for quick and accurate computation of trigonometric values in practical applications. This constancy also implies that we can talk about the sine, cosine, or tangent of an angle without referring to a specific triangle. </p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2006%20-%20Trigonometry/04-Right%20Triangle%20Trigonometry/#finding-the-value-of-trigonometric-ratios","title":"Finding the value of Trigonometric Ratios","text":"<p>Well from a na\u00efve point of view, one would find out values of trigonometric ratios of any angle by actually drawing a right-angled triangle with that angle.

He is known for creating the first trigonometric table in the 2nd century BCE. Hipparchus developed a way to solve problems in astronomy that required accurate geometric calculations, and his work laid the foundation for the field of trigonometry.</p> <p>Hipparchus's trigonometric table was based on the concept of a chord, which is a line segment connecting two points on a circle. By systematically calculating the lengths of chords for a series of angles, he effectively created a table that could be used to determine the angle subtended by a chord of a given length. This was an early form of what we now consider the sine function, although he did not use the modern sine function itself. </p> <p>His work on compiling these values into a table was revolutionary because it allowed for more precise astronomical predictions and calculations. It's believed that he used a base circle (a circle with a fixed radius) and then calculated the chord lengths for various angles by constructing and measuring geometric figures within the circle.</p> <p>The method for these calculations was based on dividing the circle into 360 degrees and then constructing a table that gave the length of the chord subtending the various angles from the center of the circle. These lengths could then be related to modern trigonometric functions. His work was further developed by later mathematicians like Claudius Ptolemy, who expanded upon Hipparchus's chords with his own works in trigonometry.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2006%20-%20Trigonometry/04-Right%20Triangle%20Trigonometry/#complementary-angles","title":"Complementary Angles","text":"<p>Two angles are said to be complementary angles if and only if their sum is 90\u00b0.</p> <p>For any angle \\( \\theta \\), the complement is \\( 90^\\circ - \\theta \\).</p> <p>In a right-angled triangle, one of the angles is 90\u00b0 and the other two are complementary.</p> <p></p> <p>The perpendicular with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is the base with respect to \\( 90^\\circ - \\theta \\) and the base with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is the perpendicular with respect to \\( 90^\\circ - \\theta \\).

But, as \\( \\theta \\) gets closer to 90 degrees, the value of \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) becomes very, very large.</p> <p>Here's a simple table to show how big the tangent function gets as the angle \\( \\theta \\) gets closer to 90 degrees:</p> Angle \\( \\theta \\) (Degrees) Tangent Value \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) 85 11.43 89 57.29 89.9 572.96 89.99 5729.58 89.999 57295.78 <p> When we consider angles \\( \\theta \\) that are less than \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) but increasingly close to it, the behavior of the tangent function, \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\), the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to \\( \\theta \\) approaches zero, while the \\( y \\)-coordinate approaches 1. As a result, the tangent function, which is the ratio of \\( y \\) over \\( x \\) (or \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) over \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\)), starts to approach positive infinity. This means that \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) becomes larger and larger as \\( \\theta \\) gets closer to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). The closer \\( \\theta \\) is to 90 degrees, the closer \\( x \\) is to zero, and the higher the value of \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) becomes, illustrating a fundamental characteristic of the tangent function near its undefined point at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).</p> <p>The graph of tan in second quadrant</p> <p>To get an idea of how the graph might look like, let us plot some points in the second quadrant.

When we approach \\(\\frac{pi}{2}\\)(\\(=90^\\circ\\)), like before the graph shoots down to negative infinity. The reason to which should be apparent by now. If not then, observe the following table:</p> \\( \\theta \\) (Degrees) \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) (Approximate Value) 95 -11.43 91 -57.29 90.1 -572.96 90.01 -5729.58 90.001 -57295.78 <p>Which makes the graph looks like this: </p> <p></p> <p>The graph of tan in third quadrant</p> <p>The graph of the tangent function, \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\), shows a notable pattern: it is identical in the first and third quadrants. This symmetry arises because of the identity \\( \\tan(\\pi + \\theta) = \\tan(\\theta) \\). Simply put, when you add \\( \\pi \\) (180 degrees) to an angle in the first quadrant, you get an angle in the third quadrant with the same tangent value. This relationship results in the tangent function having a period of \\( \\pi \\) radians, and its graph repeats every 180 degrees. So, the portion of the \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) graph from 0 to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) (first quadrant) is mirrored in the \\( \\pi \\) to \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) range (third quadrant).</p> <p>Similarly, the graph in the fourth quadrant is exactly the same as the graph in second quadrant. Interestingly the graph of tan repeats itself every \\(\\pi\\) units. Finally, we get the follwoing graph which we must remember. </p> <p></p> <p>Domain of the Tangent Function: The domain of the tangent function, which is the set of all possible input values (angles in this case), includes all real numbers except for the points where the function is undefined. From the graph, it's clear that the tangent function is undefined at \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), and every odd multiple of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) (e.g., \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{7\\pi}{2} \\), etc.), where the graph shows vertical asymptotes. Therefore, the domain of \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) can be expressed as all real numbers \\( \\theta \\) such that \\( \\theta \\neq \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.</p> <p>Range of the Tangent Function: The range of the tangent function is the set of all possible output values (tangent of the angle). From the graph, we can observe that as the function approaches its undefined points, the values of \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) increase or decrease without bound. This means that the range of the tangent function is all real numbers, which can be expressed as \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\).</p> <p>This graph is an excellent visualization of the periodic and unbounded nature of the tangent function.</p> <p>Asymtote</p> <p>An asymptote is a line that a graph gets closer and closer to, but never actually touches or crosses.

The curve of the tangent function swoops down or shoots up towards these lines as the angle gets closer to these points, but no matter how close the curve gets, it never actually touches the line. It's as if the curve is trying to reach the line but keeps on going up or down forever, getting closer and closer but never actually making contact.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2006%20-%20Trigonometry/06-graphs/#the-graph-of-cosec","title":"The graph of cosec","text":"<p>The graph of \\( \\csc(\\theta) \\) can be easily constructed from the graph of \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) since \\( \\csc(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta)} \\).

This system utilizes two axes, typically denoted as the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical), intersecting at a point called the origin, designated as (0, 0). Points in the plane are identified by ordered pairs (x, y), where x represents the horizontal distance from the origin and y the vertical distance. This innovation allowed for the algebraic representation of geometric shapes and facilitated the analysis of geometric properties using algebraic equations, significantly advancing mathematical and scientific investigations.</p> <p>The Cartesian coordinate system bridges geometry and algebra by providing a framework where geometric figures can be represented through algebraic expressions and vice versa. This conversion is achieved through several key principles:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Point Representation: Every point in the Cartesian plane is identified by an ordered pair (x, y), where 'x' and 'y' are numerical coordinates that indicate the point's position relative to two perpendicular axes, the x-axis and the y-axis. This allows geometric locations to be described algebraically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Equation of a Line: A straight line in the Cartesian plane can be expressed by a linear equation of the form y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope of the line, representing the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change between any two points on the line, and 'b' is the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This linear equation encapsulates the geometric property of a line algebraically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conic Sections: Geometric shapes such as circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, known as conic sections, are represented by quadratic equations. For example, a circle with radius 'r' centered at the origin is described by the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\). These equations provide a direct algebraic method to study the properties and relationships of geometric figures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distance Formula: The distance 'd' between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) in the plane is given by the formula \\(d = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. This formula translates a geometric concept, distance, into an algebraic expression.</p> </li> <li> <p>Slope and Angle: The slope of a line, a fundamental geometric concept indicating the direction and steepness of a line, is directly related to the tangent of the angle the line makes with the positive x-axis, providing a link between algebraic and trigonometric analyses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transformation and Translation: Geometric transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling, can be expressed algebraically using equations or matrices. For example, translating a point (x, y) by a distance (a, b) results in a new point (x + a, y + b).</p> </li> </ol> <p>By converting geometric concepts into algebraic expressions, the Cartesian coordinate system enables the use of algebraic techniques to solve geometric problems, facilitating the development of calculus and furthering the study of mathematical physics and engineering.</p> <p>The Cartesian coordinate system facilitates the conversion of geometric problems into algebraic equations by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between points in a plane and ordered pairs of real numbers. This system is defined by two perpendicular axes, typically labeled \\(x\\) (horizontal axis) and \\(y\\) (vertical axis), which intersect at a point called the origin, denoted as \\(O(0, 0)\\).</p> <p>In this framework, any point \\(P\\) in the plane can be uniquely identified by an ordered pair \\((x, y)\\), where \\(x\\) represents the horizontal distance of \\(P\\) from the origin (positive to the right and negative to the left), and \\(y\\) represents the vertical distance of \\(P\\) from the origin (positive upwards and negative downwards). This process, known as Cartesian coordinate representation, transforms geometric locations into algebraic forms, enabling the application of algebraic methods to solve geometric problems.</p> <p>For instance, geometric concepts such as lines, circles, and polygons can be represented algebraically as equations in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A line in the plane can be expressed by a linear equation \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. Similarly, a circle with radius \\(r\\) and center at \\((h, k)\\) can be described by the equation \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\).</p> <p>This algebraic representation allows for the utilization of algebraic techniques to analyze geometric properties, solve equations for intersection points, and explore the behavior of geometric shapes, effectively bridging the gap between geometry and algebra.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/Chapter%2007%20-%20Coordinate%20Geometry%20Fundamentals/01%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Coordinate%20Geometry/#cartesian-coordinate-sytem","title":"Cartesian Coordinate Sytem","text":"<p>In the Cartesian coordinate system, the location of any point on a plane is determined by measuring its distance from two perpendicular lines, known as axes, that intersect at a point called the origin.

Consider a point moving in a plane with complete freedom; it can traverse any part of the plane without constraints. This scenario changes fundamentally when restrictions are imposed on the movement of the point. These restrictions, which dictate the path the point can follow, define a locus. For instance, if a point is constrained to remain equidistant from two given points, say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), its path is not arbitrary. The locus of all positions that the point can occupy under this restriction is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). This line, the perpendicular bisector, consists of all points in the plane that are equidistant to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

In simpler terms, when we set certain rules for how a point can move on a plane, these rules can sometimes lead to the creation of smooth paths, known as curves. These curves are made up of countless points that all follow the rules we've set. For example, if the rule is that a point must always stay the same distance from a center point, the curve formed by all the points that follow this rule is a circle. Similarly, if the rule is that the distance from a point to a fixed line must always be the same, the curve formed is a parabola. These rules are often written down as equations, and studying these curves helps us understand the connection between the rules (equations) and the shapes or paths they create on the plane.
